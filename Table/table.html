                  <h1>Responsive table fun</h1>
            <p>
              Sometimes you have tabular data that needs to work on large and small screens alike, but viewing tables on small screens can be a nightmare. If you have to scroll horizontally to get to the end of each row, it's easy to lose track of which row you were on. This example uses a media query for small screens, and some nifty flexbox properties to turn each table row into it's own 'card' on smaller screens. Give your browser a stretch and try it out.
